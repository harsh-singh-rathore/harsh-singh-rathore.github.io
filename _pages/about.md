I'm Harsh Rathod, an adept backend engineer based in Bangalore, recognized by the moniker HSR. My professional journey revolves around crafting robust backend solutions, specializing in seamless system deployment and fortifying security measures.

In my role as an Associate Software Engineer at Shell, I focus extensively on backend development and collaborate closely with the DevOps team. I am responsible for fortifying critical systems and implementing security measures to safeguard against potential vulnerabilities. It's an exciting journey where I contribute to building a secure and efficient technological landscape at Shell.

At EliteFit.AI, as a Software Engineering Intern, I delved into the intricacies of user analytics and automation. I played a pivotal role in developing user analytics reporting using Vue.js, Express.js, AWS, and PostgreSQL. Additionally, I contributed to automating AI-generated stickers using Python and Express.js for the backend. Another feather in my cap was developing an automation tool using AWS Lambda to verify and update database videos, reducing processing time by a whopping 200%.

The intersection of backend expertise and machine learning applications truly shines through in these experiences. From enhancing user experiences at EliteFit.AI, and Shell to crafting secure and efficient applications, I really enjoy working in technology and strive towards becoming better.
