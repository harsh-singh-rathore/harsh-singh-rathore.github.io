I'm Harsh Rathod, an adept backend engineer based in Bangalore, recognized by the moniker HSR. My professional journey revolves around crafting robust backend solutions, specializing in seamless system deployment and fortifying security measures.

At EliteFit.ai, as a Software Engineering Intern, I delved into the intricacies of user analytics and automation. I played a pivotal role in developing user analytics reporting using Vue.js, Express.js, AWS, and PostgreSQL. Additionally, I contributed to automating AI-generated stickers using Python and Express.js for the backend. Another feather in my cap was developing an automation tool using AWS Lambda to verify and update database videos, reducing processing time by a whopping 200%.

One of my notable projects is the CompeteInML web portal â€“ a secure and innovative platform designed to replace Kaggle for internal competitions. Leveraging Python, FastAPI, and MongoDB, this portal is a testament to my dedication to creating practical, industry-specific solutions. By introducing a role-based competition system, CompeteInML provides enhanced security, efficient competition management, and complete control over organizational data.

The intersection of backend expertise and machine learning applications truly shines through in these experiences. From enhancing user experiences at EliteFit.ai to crafting secure and efficient portals like CompeteInML, my commitment to excellence spans both realms of technology.
